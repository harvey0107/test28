    <div>"During this uncertain time, I was recently able to quickly schedule a service appointment with Orkin. Before arrival, there was great communication between myself and my technician, Josh Ruth. Josh was efficient, courteous and extremely knowledgeable. He initiated the right precautions during the current pandemic and was agreeable to my requests. I hope Josh continues to service us in the future.""During this uncertain time, I was recently able to quickly schedule a service appointment with Orkin.
